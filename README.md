# Arduino-Projects
These projects are done through UCI IEEE Open Project Space 

IMU Brightness Indicator : <br />
* Brightness of 3 LEDs changed based on the orientation of the IMU 
* Used I2C to communicate with IMU 

IR Emitter and IR Receiver : <br />
* Created a distance sensor using IR Emitter and IR Receiver 
* The brightness of LED changes depends on the distance between IR Emitter and IR Receiver

Red Light Green Light Game SPI : <br />
* Press the corresponding button according to the flasing LED light
* Two arduinos are communicating through SPI communication protocol (Radios) 

Red Light Green Light Game UART : <br />
* It is the same game as the Red Light Green Light Game SPI but used UART communication protocols
